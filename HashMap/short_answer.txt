Assignment 3: STL HashMap (short answer questions)

Milestone 1:
1.  at() or [] ?
A:  [] would modify the object, while at() does not;
    so we cannot overload [] by cast easily.

2.  Find vs find ?
A:  use HashMap::find;
    Cause it locates the bucket directly, And std::find will loop all buckets.

3.  RAII ?
A:  RAII-compliant;
    Constructor Acquires, Destructor Releases.

4.  Briefly explain the implementation of HashMapIterator's operator++. How does it work and what checks does it have?
A:  by _bucket - which imply current bucket, _node - which imply current elem in this bucket;
    check if _node till nullptr and if _bucket out of size.

Milestone 2:
5.  Why we need to implement the special member functions in the HashMap class,but we can default in the HashMapIterator class?
A:  Cause we need deep copy in HashMap Class, the bucket vector is a series of ptr, we want Memory it point to;
    Also due to rule of 5, the dtor had been already overloaded;
    In HashMapIterator we do manipulate ptr.

6.  why did you have to std::move each member, even though the parameter (named rhs) is already an r-value reference?
A:  rhs itself is a l-value.
